# TagFresno

**TagFresno** is a playful, interactive graffiti canvas built to bring **code into the art world**—starting with ArtHop in Fresno, CA.

Visitors can draw directly onto real photos of local landmarks using a tablet or stylus, adding their mark to a digital wall. It's a mix of art, humor, and experimentation built entirely in the browser.

## Why This Exists

This project is both a **personal experiment** and a **public invitation**.

I've always wanted to bring **code** into spaces where it usually isn’t seen—places like ArtHop, where the focus is traditionally on physical or visual art. TagFresno is one attempt to bridge that gap.

> It’s okay if people walk away with nothing more than a smile.  
> It’s even better if they think, *“Huh… that was code?”*

## What Visitors Can Do

- Draw graffiti over real Fresno photos using a digital canvas
- See their creations displayed alongside others
- Save or print their “tag” as a memento
- Share a laugh, surprise themselves, and leave a little digital trace

It’s about having fun, expressing something small, and exploring what “tech art” can feel like in a community setting.

## Tech Stack

- **React** (with Vite)
- **Fabric.js** for the drawing canvas
- **Python (WIP)** for background removal (green screen photos)
- **Canvas + Image export**
- Hosted locally during ArtHop, with plans for a public online version

## Future Ideas

This is just the start. Some directions I might explore:
- Save + remix other people's tags
- Add collaborative graffiti modes
- Green screen portraits layered into your tag
- Mobile version with QR access
- Projector “graffiti wall” during events

## Credits & Community

Photos will be taken around Fresno by me, or open to contributions from others in the community.
Placeholder images may be seen until the final project is completed.  
If you're an artist, coder, or just curious — come talk to me!
