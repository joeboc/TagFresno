# TagFresno

**TagFresno** is a playful, interactive graffiti canvas built to bring a bit of **code into the art world**

Visitors can draw directly onto real photos of local landmarks using a tablet or stylus, adding their mark to a digital wall. It's a mix of art, humor, and experimentation built into a browser.

## Why This Exists

This project is a **personal experiment** .

I've always wanted to bring **code** into spaces where it usually isn’t seen. TagFresno is one attempt to bridge that gap.

## What Visitors Can Do

- Draw graffiti over real Fresno photos using a digital canvas
- See their creations displayed alongside others
- Save or print their “tag” as a memento 
---

## Tech Stack

- **React** (with Vite)
- **Fabric.js** for the drawing canvas
- **Python (WIP)** for background removal (green screen photos)
- **Canvas + Image export**
- Hosted locally during ArtHop, with plans for a public online version

## Credits & Community

Photos will be taken around Fresno by me, or open to contributions from others in the community.
Placeholder images may be seen until the final project is completed.  
If you're an artist, coder, or curious feel free to reach out
